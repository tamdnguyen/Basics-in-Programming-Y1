# ROUND 2, Control statements: conditions and loops

The concept of this round is about conditional statement "if",
logical operation, nested and chained if-statement, and while loop.

## Exercise 1

In the module "speed_camera", write a program that asks the user 
for a speed in kilometres per hour (integer). 
Based on the speed, the program prints whether that speed would 
result in a fine.

If the value entered by the user is at least 45, it is enough 
for a fine.

## Exercise 2

The user is thinking of getting contact lenses and wants to know 
whether it would be better to choose daily lenses or monthly 
lenses. Write a program that calculates which one of these options
is better for the user.

## Exercise 3

Write a program that estimates user's risk of developing type 2 
diabetes. Program asks user's age in years, height in centimeters,
weight in kilograms, and genetic basis and scores the answers 
according to the instructions below.

## Exercise 4

Write a program that asks the user for the values of the stock trades. The program calculates and prints the brokerage fees charged by the bank. The brokerage fees are calculated separately for each trade as follows

- if the value of the the stock trade is less than 800 euros, the brokerage fee is 1 % of the transaction.
- if the value of the stock trade is at least 800 euros, the brokerage fee is 0.2 % of the transaction, or at least 8 euros.
